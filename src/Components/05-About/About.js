				<div>About Me</div>
				<div>
					Iâ€™m a 23-year old frontend developer, with a background in business
					and a passion for design, based in the New York Metropolitan Area.
					Utilizing my skills in organization and time management, I create
					thoughtfully planned out web applications. With an interest and tact
					for design, I have a passion in creating and coding aesthetic UIs for
					an enhanced experience. I am a great team player, but I also value
					autonomy. I love to listen to music or true crime podcasts as I
					wireframe and code. In my free time, my hobbies are watching
					TV/movies, crocheting, and playing Animal Crossing.
