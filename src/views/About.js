				I am a frontend developer, with a background in business and a passion
				for design, based in the New York Metropolitan Area. Utilizing my skills
				in organization and time management, I create thoughtfully planned out
				web applications. With an interest and tact for design, I have a passion
				in creating and coding aesthetic UIs for an enhanced experience. I am a
				great team player, but I also value autonomy. I love to listen to music
				or true crime podcasts as I wireframe and code. In my free time, my
				hobbies are watching TV/movies, crocheting, and playing Animal Crossing.
